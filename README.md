To run the code you are going to have to download the dataset. The dataset is part of a drive folder that contains everything in the correct format, as that will be important for the program to run.

You just need to put that downloaded folder in this directory after it's been extracted. Each notebook contains information about this dataset, from pre-processing to analysis etc.
